# LinkBook

LinkBook is a prototype of a Goodreads-like mobile application that combines a social media platform with a library-style catalog. It focuses on French literature, allowing users to discover, organize, and discuss books through a modern and interactive experience.

The application aggregates data from a large database of French books and enriches it with external content such as reviews, interviews, and videos, providing users with a richer discovery journey.
